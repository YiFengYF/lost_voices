## Premise

In a distant galaxy teeming with diverse alien life, one planet stands above the rest: SaphirA. This advanced society draws countless immigrants with its promise of a better life. To ease assimilation, newcomers must undergo a mandatory language implant that will make them native speakers of Saphirian.

As a recent immigrant, you find that life on SaphirA isn't quite what you expected. As you navigate the complexities of a society riddled with discrimination, you notice that the diverse cultures and characteristics you'd anticipated seem to have vanished. The once-colorful tapestry of alien life has been reduced to a monotonous sameness.

Determined to unravel this mystery, you delve deeper into the reality of what SaphirA is. As the startling secrets come to light, you face a life-altering decision that will challenge your beliefs and determine your future in the galaxy. In Lost Voices, you must decide: will you try to be like everyone else for the sake of peace and safety, or be who you are at a price.
